PS3KVA communication protocol similar to Modbus RTU for RS232 ?
Question for GitHub users
I am searching for the protocol for my PS3KVA Inverter Charger, what, I think, was the product of Shenzhen Snat Energy Electrical Technology Co.,Ltd, China. 
I try to ask this faktorz staff for this protocol and I am now waiting for their response.

Similar inverter is REVO VM...kW with similar protocol, sure, from similar firm SOROTEC from Shenzhen.

I know, there is the software WatchPower, but I need this protocol for another purpose and project.

I think, this protocol can be so as Modbus RTU protocol, but if it is in a different form, I will invite it, too.

So thank you for your help in advance from PavelOu.
