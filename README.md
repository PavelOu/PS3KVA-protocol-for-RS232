PS3KVA communication protocol similar to Modbus RTU or Ansi for RS232 

waw a question for GitHub users ...

I was searching for the protocol for my PS3KVA Inverter Charger, what, I have thought, 
was the product of **Shenzhen Snat Energy Electrical Technology Co. Ltd, China.**

I try to ask this factory staff and similar factories for this protocol and I was waiting for their response, mostly forever ...

Similar inverter was REVO VM...kW with maybe a similar protocol, 
from similar firm **SOROTEC** from Shenzhen.

I have tried to contact a different china productor of solar inverters, 
but never one can help me and send me this protocol for my PS3KVA.

I have found self on web of OptiSolar the software/programm WatchPower, 
what works with my PS3KVA well, but I need this protocol for another my purpose and project.

I have thought at first, this protocol can be so as Modbus RTU or Ascii one, 
but if it is in a different form, I could possibly use it, too.

So I was searching for this protocol and I was waiting for a help in advance from Github users.

Most of ones used RevoVM ... from Sorotec, what I have found on pages of Github user [Jblance](https://github.com/jblance)

So I had to search and experiment mostly same one ... for about 3 months ...
and how I was succesfull you can find in my nesxt issues and comments on pages of user Jblance

I thank you all users, who hepl me in my terrible searching with many of China characters etc. -:)

I have found for my PS3KVA a protocol Modbus Ansi with CRC Xmodem like PI30, 
but I did not found the original of it or a similar one ... 
so I need to reconstruct it far ...
